Timer for a Vivint Event. Used a node function to calculate the designed time of the event and current event. Then count down the number using the SetInterval function.

# "Find My Vivint Plan" Page

"Find My Vivint Plan" page is for making a customized plan for the user to increase the sales of Vivint. For Question and Answer functions, users can go back to change their answers and see what their answers were. Users can also see their progress in the progress bar to see how many questions to go. 

# "Check My Home Safety" Page

"Check My Home Safety" page is for helping users to check their safety that might lead them to buy Vivint plan or products. It integrated the same function for question and answer that was used in "Find My Vivint Plan" page. For the Grade and Medal animation, I used a Canvas and animation function. I didn't downloaded the image or gif to increase the loading speed. These animations entertain users and point them to Vivint Plan and products. 

# Grade Functions
With the "Check My Home Safety" Page, I made functions to check their grade and make a percentile to display. There are A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, and F Grades by users answers.

If they get below 50%, they get a "bronze medal." If they get higher than 50% but smaller than 90%, they get a "Silver" medal.

If they get higher than 90%, they get a "gold medal." These are the effects using HTML5 Canvas. 

# SlideShow Functions

With SlideShow Function, I used a transition and float of CSS and JavaScript functions to display slides. For the buttons, I used addEventListener and removeEventListener to add and remove hover style for the buttons to indicate users that they cannot slick prev button when it's the first item and next button when it is the last item. 

# Continuing Playing Video Without Audio Content

I used a Video element and added attributes of autoplay, muted, and loop. I also set control and preload to false or none. I also set the video_text element to make a text over a video. For the rounded edge, I used a video_mask element with overflow:hidden with border roundedness.
